# firefox_theme
A theme tweak for Firefox and derived browsers like Floorp where the navigation bar is placed to the right on the tab-bar.

![sample](/image.jpg)

Place `userChrome.css` from the `chrome` folder in your `userprofile/path/chrome` folder. Make one if a `chrome` folder does not exist.
To find this user folder type `about:support` in the address bar and click on the open folder button of the `Profile Folder` field.

You also need to change these settings in `about:config`
- toolkit.legacyUserProfileCustomizations.stylesheets > true
- browser.compactmode.show > true

In Floorp my browser theme is set to "Firefox Proton UI" but other will probably also work. In Firefox it is set to the default dark theme.
